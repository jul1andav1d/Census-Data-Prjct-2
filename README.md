# PROJECT 2 PART 1
This will be a space to work on one of these two datasets below. 
One will be chosen to do supervised Machine Learning. After Choosing a Dataset, all work will be commited to Github.

- For Dataset #1 'European Union lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender survey (2012)' LICENSE AND ACCESS RESTRICTIONS: Public Domain

- For Dataset #2 'Predicting income exceeds $50K/yr based on census data.' Dataset information can be found here:

# PROJECT 2 PART 2

For this part of the project, I used the approved dataset from the ones I proposed before, and started cleaning and exploring the data set.


# PROJECT 2 PART 3

The links below contain Presentation slides and video for this part of the project.

I created an 8 min video presentation with slide show designed for a technical audience addressesing my data preparation and exploratory analysis for my selected data set. 
(The census Data 1994)

# PROJECT 2 PART 4

For part 4 of my second project, I tried two models and tuned the hyperparameters for both to optimize the performance. I evaluated the model performance with a Classification Report and Confusion Matrix. And then based on all these processing steps, chose a model with a justified decision.

# PROJECT 2 PART 5

For this final part of the Project, I created a few visualizations to better understand my data. These visualizations were included in a PowerPoint presentation linked below.
This presentation includes background information on my dataset, information for the modeling techniques used, and final recommendations and Conclusions.
